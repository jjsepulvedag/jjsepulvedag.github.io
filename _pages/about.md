You have reached my site! here I share some of my work and interests. 

I am a civil engineer graduated with honors from the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. I also hold a Master of Engineering in Geotechnics and am pursuing a PhD in Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering at the University of Canterbury (New Zealand). 

This page remains under construction. Any constructive comments will be greatly appreciated. 

Feel free to reach me through any of these two emails: juanjose.sepulvedagarcia@pg.canterbury.ac.nz, jjsepulvedag@unal.edu.co.
